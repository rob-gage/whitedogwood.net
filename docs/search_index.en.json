Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic\nEvery integer greater than 1 has one unique prime factorization, if it is not a prime number itself. The uniqueness of each number's prime factorization allows prime numbers to be used as the\nrepresentation of data or symbols. If different primes are assigned to different symbols, then multiplying them together yields a unique numerical encoding. By factoring the code number back into primes, we can recover the symbols, making primes a perfect method for encoding data numerically.\n\nRepresenting Ordered Symbols\nIf the word DOG is simply represented as 2 x 3 x 5, it will result in the encoding of 30, which has a prime factorization that can be read as 5 x 3 x 2, leading to potential misconceptions about the divinity of canines. However, if we tie each prime to a unique position in the sequence instead, and apply exponents to them, associated with the symbols in those positions, the sequence order is preserved.\nThe following steps must be followed to encode ordered data:\n\n\nAssign each position in the sequence a unique prime number:\n\n1st position → 2\n2nd position → 3\n3rd position → 5\n\n\n\nAssign an exponent to each symbol. These do not have to be prime:\n\nD → 1\nO → 2\nG → 3\n\n\n\nUse the exponent associated with each symbol to exponentiate the prime number associated with its position in the sequence, and then take the product of all the exponentiated primes:\n2¹ x 3² x 5³ = 2250\n\n\nDecode the number by computing its prime factorization, and use the exponent of each unique prime factor to determine which symbol it corresponds to:\n\nexponent of 2: 1 → D\nexponent of 3: 2 → O\nexponent of 5: 3 → G\n\n\n\n2250 has prime factorization 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 5 x 5 allowing the letter at any given position to be known. This can be distinguished from 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 to prevent the order of symbols being confused.\n\nWriting a Program to Encode Words\nLets implement this encoding method in Haskell.\nFirst we will create a data type representing the symbols (in this case, letters in the Hebrew alefbet).\n\nWe will also need a function to convert a Symbol to its corresponding exponent. It must increment the default index provided by the Enum typeclass, since 0 cannot be used as an exponent in the encoding.\n\nWe will also need a function to generate an infinite list of primes to use for encoding words of any length. This can be done easily in Haskell using a common algorithm known (somewhat incorrectly) as the Sieve of Eratosthanes.\n\nWe can now write the function to encode a list of symbols as a unique Integer.\n\n\n","description":"A method of encoding data using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic","id":"https://rob-gage.github.io/posts/2025-10-2-encoding-data-with-prime-numbers/","path":"/posts/2025-10-2-encoding-data-with-prime-numbers/","title":"Encoding Data with Prime Numbers"},"https://rob-gage.github.io/posts/2025-7-26-interaction-nets/":{"body":"\nWhat are Interaction Nets?\nInteraction nets were introduced in 1990 by mathematician Yves Lafont as a graphical way of representing computations and transformations, generalized from Proof Nets. Interaction nets are graphs of interconnected \"agents\" that \"interact\" according to certain rules. These interactions can be evaluated in any order to produce the same final result. They also do not affect other parts of the graph beyond the interacting agents, meaning interactions can be applied in parallel.\n\nInteraction Net Structure\nIn most interaction nets, agents may have zero or more auxiliary ports, but must have exactly one principal port, which determines interactions (some proposed variations of interaction nets allow more than one principal port). When two agents are connected via their principal ports, they form an active pair, and can be rewritten according to the rules of the interaction system.\n\nExamples\nThe following examples will use these agent types:\n\nR: Root agent that connects to the output of the computation\nx and y: Input variables\nAND, OR, and NOT: Boolean logical operators AND, OR, and NOT\nT and F: True and false Boolean values\n\nThe first example represents a simple interaction net based program to flip Boolean values using the unary agent NOT, which interacts with whatever data is substituted for x, and returns the result through the auxiliary port.\n\n\n\t\n\nThe next example shows a use of the Boolean OR, which rewrites the graph differently based on what boolean it interacts with.\n\n\n\t\n\nA T (true Boolean value) agent interacting with OR's principal port will directly connect to R.\n\n    \n    \n\nHowever, as shown below, if the agent connected via OR is F, the graph will be rewritten differently to eliminate the F and the OR, and connect the variable y to R.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nInteraction Nets for Optimal Evaluation\nThe properties of interaction nets make them a very attractive option for designing a runtime or evaluator for automatically parallel computations. A program written for such a runtime could be processed concurrently on the processor's many cores without any additional effort needed for handling synchronization and multithreading issues. This would allow massively parallel execution of code on GPUs too without writing a single line of CUDA or HIP. Machine learning models could be represented as interaction nets to ensure correct and efficient training and inference in a sharded processing environment, such as a datacenter with many interconnected high-performance-compute devices.\n","description":"An explanation of interaction nets and some examples","id":"https://rob-gage.github.io/posts/2025-7-26-interaction-nets/","path":"/posts/2025-7-26-interaction-nets/","title":"Interaction Nets"},"https://rob-gage.github.io/posts/2025-8-10-concatenative-programming/":{"body":"\nAbout Concatenative Programming\nConcatenative programming is an elegant programming style using sequenced point-free (tacit) functions (functions with anonymous arguments) to compose entire programs. Functions and programs are simply\nsequenced applications of other functions.\nConcatenative languages are usually implemented on stacks, with function arguments being consumed\nfrom the top of the stack, and outputs placed back on the top. The arguments of functions being on the stack prior to function application often results in concatenative languages using a Reverse\nPolish Notation (RPN, also called postfix notation) for arithmetic operations.\nThe standard infix expression 9 + 3 is written in RPN as 9 3 +. Infix expression 5 - 4 is\nwritten as 5 4 - in RPN. In stack-based concatenative languages, number literals are often\ntreated as functions that produce that number on top of the stack to be consumed by following\nfunctions. As described, 10 / 2 - 2 is written as 10 2 / 2 -.\n\nForth\nThe first concatenative language was the stack-based Forth. It had an interactive programming\nenvironment that allowed \"words\" (functions) to be defined, and used in other word definitions. Since its creation in the 1960s, many variants, both free and proprietary, have emerged. It was designed for systems with limited hardware capabilities.\n\nJoy\nJoy was a functional concatenative language. Every function is a pure function, consuming and returning the stack. It can also store \"quoted\" programs on the stack as data, to be consumed and\nused by other functions. Functions can be composed simply by concatenating the bodies of functions as quoted programs.\n\nFactor\nFactor is a full-featured concatenative language with a compiler and standard library. It is more designed for practical use than Joy, and has a web framework, Furnace, along with a database library.\n\nCompose\nI have been developing a simple and comprehensible concatenative language named Compose. A function to square a number in Compose is written as follows:\nsquare : copy * ;\nWhen applied to the number 5 like 5 square, functions can be substituted quite simply by\nreplacing them with their terms to produce 5 copy *. 5 copy * becomes 5 5 *, which becomes\n25.\nFunctions as data are called lambdas in Compose, and they are represented with parentheses.\nThe code ( copy * ) copy compose will evaluate to a leave lambda ( copy * copy * ), allowing\neasy function composition at runtime. 5 ( copy * ) apply evaluates to 36.\n","description":"Information about concatenative programming, and about specific concatenative languages","id":"https://rob-gage.github.io/posts/2025-8-10-concatenative-programming/","path":"/posts/2025-8-10-concatenative-programming/","title":"Concatenative Programming"},"https://rob-gage.github.io/posts/2025-9-27-parser-combinators/":{"body":"\nParsing Programming Languages\nMost programming language compilers use a parser generator or a handwritten parser to parse the language and construct the syntax tree. Handwritten parsers provide the most control, allowing detailed errors to be constructed while being very performant. Parser generators turn high-level grammar descriptions into highly optimized state machine based parsers. Another elegant approach is parser combinators. These combinators can be composed into parsers with other combinators, allowing the entire parser to be constructed in a purely functional manner.\n\nWhat Are Parser Combinators?\nParser combinators are not often seen in compilers for common languages however. Implementing them in lower level languages like C would be awkward, and purely functional languages like Haskell come with unwanted overhead, and a lack of programmers that know how to use them.\n\nHow They Can Be Optimized\nMany performance issues with parser combinators arise from issues that are perfectly fixable with the right language:\n\nFunction call overhead -&gt; Can be fixed in any language that allows control over inlining.\nExcessive Allocation -&gt; The allocations used to store errors and output can be optimized away when the errors and output aren't needed with clever use of parameterized types.\nRedundant Parsing of Long Branches -&gt; Parsers may repeatedly attempt the same branch for overlapping prefixes; caching results avoids this.\n\n\nPups - My Parser Combinator Library\nRust’s zero-cost abstractions make parser combinators practical for language parsing. However, existing solutions were not quite right for my use case. The nom crate seems mainly designed for byte/text based input, and I was wanting to tokenize my programming language syntax before parsing, so I wanted something designed to be more general purpose with a more transparent API. Chumsky seemed to be what I wanted at first, but I didn't want the lack of type-level distinction between fatal errors, and accumulated recoverable errors.\nI decided to create Pups to address these gaps. By designing it to easily allow handwritten parsers to be used alongside parser combinators, I will have a future-proof way of writing parsers that allows rapid iteration, but full control when necessary. I've been working on several small-to-large language projects, and having my own library will also allow me to improve the tooling for all of them simultaneously.\n","description":"An explanation of common parsing methods for programming languages, an introduction to parser combinators, and why I chose to write my own parser library","id":"https://rob-gage.github.io/posts/2025-9-27-parser-combinators/","path":"/posts/2025-9-27-parser-combinators/","title":"Parser Combinators"},"https://rob-gage.github.io/posts/compose-language-introduction/":{"body":"\nAbout Compose\nCompose is my concatenative language, designed for writing concise functions and programs in a tacit style. Functions are made up of data terms and function applications.\n\nData terms\nWhen data terms are encountered, such as 10 or false or ( copy * ), they are pushed to the virtual machine's stack. The most recently pushed data will be consumed first by applied functions.\n\nFunctions\n\nCore Functions\nCompose provides a number of core functions that can be evaluated such as arithmetic operations, Boolean logic operations, and stack operations such as copy, drop, swap and others. Along with data terms, these are the main building blocks of any other function or program.\n\nNamed Functions\nNamed functions can be defined by writing their identifiers, and then their function bodies (delimited by a : and a ;).

They allow computations to be written as graphs of interconnected agents, with defined rules specifying how these agents are rewritten when they are connected via their principal ports. These rewrites, or interactions, can be evaluated in any order to produce the same final result, and can be evaluated concurrently by different processors.\n\nThe Problem With Standard Interaction Nets\nIn the original paper by Yves Lafont, agents must have one and only one principal port. This provides the very useful guarantee that interaction nets will be evaluated deterministically. While this architecture is very sound at an abstract level, when implemented for computer languages it becomes less than optimal for massively parallel program evaluation. Any operation with more than one operand implemented in an interaction nets system can only process one operand at a time. For example, a binary operation like Boolean AND takes two booleans as input, but it only needs to know that one of them is false to produce a result. In a standard interaction net system, if the first operand (connected to the principal port) is not immediately available, the operation cannot continue even if the second operand is sufficient to determine result.\n\nPolyactive Agents\nWhen toying around with a runtime implementation for standard interaction nets, I quickly realized how imperfect they are for modeling dependencies in a computation that may not be satisfied in a predetermined order. The natural extension of the system, it seemed, was to allow agents to interact on one of many \"active\" ports, rather than having a single principal port. Before learning that these had already been conceived of as \"multiport\" agents, I termed them as \"polyactive\", which I strongly prefer and will continue to call them by to avoid confusion (since \"multiport\" could accurately describe standard agents with any amount of auxiliary ports). These polyactive agents allow operation inputs to be received in any order, and in some cases, reduce the number of necessary steps to solve a computation.\n\nExample\nThis example uses the same agent types in my previous post about interaction nets, but revised so that the Boolean operator agents have two principal ports to receive inputs, and only one auxiliary port to produce the result.\nAs shown below, an AND with two ports can be rewritten immediately if it is connected to F via either of its principal ports, connecting the F to the receiver of the AND's output, but if either is connected to a T, the agent connected to the other principal port will be connected to the receiver of the AND's output.\n\n\n\t\n\n\nExtra Reading\n\n\nInteraction Nets - Lafont\n\n\nMultiport Interaction Nets and Concurrency - Mazza\n\n\nInteraction Nets: Semantics and Concurrent Extensions - Mazza\n\n\n","description":"An explanation of a flaw in standard interaction nets that makes them less than optimal for parallel evaluation, and a variation of them that solves this flaw","id":"https://rob-gage.github.io/posts/polyactive-agents-multiple-principal-ports/","path":"/posts/polyactive-agents-multiple-principal-ports/","title":"Polyactive Agents: Multiple Principal Ports"},"https://rob-gage.github.io/projects/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://rob-gage.github.io/projects/","path":"/projects/","title":"Projects"},"https://rob-gage.github.io/projects/compose-md/":{"body":"\nThe Compose Language\nCompose is a concatenative, stack-based programming language. Programs in Compose are built by writing sequenced functions that modify the stack. Compose is functional programming inspired and makes use of functions as data. Capturing the execution context by treating the stack as data is also possible.\nIn concatenative languages, the flow of data is entirely determined by the stack. Each function operates on the stack: it takes some number of values from the top, performs a computation, and pushes results back onto the stack. Calling two functions side by side means “apply the first function, then the second, passing along the stack as the argument.”\nFor example, in a simple concatenative style:\n2 3 +\nThis pushes 2 and 3 onto the stack, then applies the + function, adding the two numbers and leaving 5 on the stack.\nCompose follows this model with a minimal set of primitives, allowing programs to be constructed by composing small, reusable functions. Its design emphasizes consistent stack behavior and predictable composition, keeping the core language simple and easily comprehensible.\n\nFeatures\n\nLambda Composition\nCompose allows functions to be stored as data on the stack as lambdas, and these lambdas can be composed into more complex functions. They can be manipulated like other stack data, and passed around as arguments for other functions.\n\n\nList Processing\nCompose provides the map, filter, and fold functions for processing lists. Lists can store an unlimited number of items, and do not require that their elements be the same type.\n\n\nRecursive Functions\nCompose allows the definition of recursive functions.
